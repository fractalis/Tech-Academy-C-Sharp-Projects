# C# Projects

These are some small projects I made using C# and the .NET Framework

## Projects:
---

### Car Insurance

 This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It
 collects a number of inputs from the user on policy information and calculates a quote based
 on a number of business rules. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view
 all the quotes that have been issued.

 ### Twenty One

  This project is a console based implementation of the class Twenty One card game. It is
  implemented as a class library and exposed to the console application via a light-weight
  interface that allows for actually playing the game.
